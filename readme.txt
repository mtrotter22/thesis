This work was done by Matthew Trotter with close observation by Federico
Uquillas, under the supervision of PI Dr. Jesse Gomez at Princeton
University. This work is part of a larger project contributing to the
thesis requirement for graduation at Princeton for Matthew, under the
requirements put forth by the Princeton Neuroscience Institute.


Notes:


The "left" & "right" distinctions in sorting are for the cerebellar ROI. 
That is, the "left" folder contains all models where the cerebellar ROI
was of the left side. That means the thalamic and neocortical ROIs in
the "left" folder will still be on the right side of the brain.
